The fleet TUI is a terminal dashboard for managing your apps. Launch it with `sudo fleet` or `sudo fleet tui`.

## Navigation model

The TUI has three top-level views you cycle through with **Tab**:

1. **Dashboard** — app list with status
2. **Health** — health check results for all apps
3. **Secrets** — vault management (seal/unseal, view/edit secrets)

From any top-level view you can drill into detail views (app detail, logs, secret editing) and return with **Esc**.

## Global shortcuts

These work from every view (except the secret editor, which captures all input):

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Cycle between Dashboard, Health, Secrets |
| `Esc` | Go back to previous view |
| `q` | Quit the TUI |
| `x` | Toggle secret redaction (show/hide values) |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcut help overlay |

## List navigation

All scrollable lists share the same controls:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Move selection down |
| `k` / `↑` | Move selection up |
| `Enter` | Select item / confirm action |

Lists scroll automatically when the cursor moves beyond the visible window. Indicators show when items exist above or below the viewport.

## Secrets shortcuts

Available in the Secrets view:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `u` | Unseal the vault |
| `l` | Seal the vault |
| `a` | Add a new secret |
| `d` | Delete the selected secret |
| `r` | Reveal / hide the selected value |

<Aside type="caution">
Destructive actions (delete, seal) show a confirmation prompt. Press `y` to confirm or `n` / `Esc` to cancel.
</Aside>

## Logs shortcuts

When viewing logs for a specific app:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `f` | Toggle follow mode (live-stream new lines) |
| `Esc` | Return to app detail |

## Help overlay

Press `?` at any time to see the full shortcut reference grouped by Navigation, Actions, and Secrets. Press any key to dismiss.

## Privilege requirements

The TUI requires **root** (`sudo fleet`) because it calls `systemctl`, reads the vault, and talks to the Docker daemon. Read-only commands like `fleet status` work without root.
